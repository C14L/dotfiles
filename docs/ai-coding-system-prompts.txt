Useful AI-IDE system prompts
============================

Notes
-----

Let the AI write tests. Integrations tests often work best.

Use a popular tech stack so that the AI had plenty of material to learn from.

Ask AI to refactor the code using low-risk refactoring.

Commit to Git frequently to have safe points.

Cursor/Windsurf AI have a chat history with safe points for each chat entry.

In Cursor and Windsurf, system prompts can be added to files under `project-root/.cursor/rules/some-rules-file.md`. Or Windsurf.

Cursor uses .mdc files when using the Cursor settings UI to edit the rules.

# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don’t have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming

# Technical stack

- Python for the backend
- html/js for the frontend
- SQL databases, never JSON file storage
- Separate databases for dev, test, and prod
- Elasticsearch for search, using elastic.co hosting
- elastic.co will have dev and prod indexes
- Python tests

# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
