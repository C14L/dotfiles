[::]:80 is a ipv6 address.

This error can be caused if you have a nginx configuration that is listening on port 80 and also on port [::]:80.

I had the following in my default sites-available file:

listen 80;
listen [::]:80 default_server;
You can fix this by adding ipv6only=on to the [::]:80 like this:

listen 80;
listen [::]:80 ipv6only=on default_server;
